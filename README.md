Project Overview

This project focuses on data analysis and dashboard creation in Excel using the dataset HA Data.csv.xlsx. The dashboard was designed to make the data more interactive, visual, and easier to interpret.

Key Analysis Performed

Data Cleaning & Preparation – Removed inconsistencies and structured the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Analysis – Summarized the data using pivot tables and key metrics.

Trend Analysis – Identified patterns over time to understand how the data changes.

Comparisons – Compared categories (e.g., readmission rates,total patients, time in hospital) to find meaningful differences.

Visualization – Designed an interactive Excel dashboard with charts, slicers, and KPIs to present insights clearly.

Insights from the Dashboard

📊 High-Level Metrics
Total Patients: 66,587

Readmitted Patients: 30,693

Readmission Rate: 46.09%

Average Time in Hospital: 6.78 days

🔍 Insight: Nearly half of the patients are being readmitted, which is a significant figure. This could indicate issues in post-discharge care, chronic conditions, or ineffective initial treatments.

👥 Demographic Breakdown
Gender Filter: Includes Female, Male, Unknown/Invalid

Age Groups: All age brackets from [0–10) to [90–100)

🔍 Insight: Despite the age segmentation, the bar chart for readmission rate by age shows 0.00% across all groups, which suggests either:

A data issue (e.g., missing values or incorrect aggregation)

Or that the age-based readmission logic hasn’t been implemented correctly in the dashboard.

This is a red flag worth investigating further.

🧁 Readmission Visuals
Pie Chart – Readmitted Diabetes Patients: Highlights the proportion of diabetic patients among those readmitted.

Pie Chart – Overall Readmission Rates: Reinforces the 46.09% figure visually.

🔍 Insight: If diabetes is a major contributor to readmissions, targeted interventions for diabetic patients could reduce overall rates.

🏥 Specialty & Medication Analysis
Line Graph – Average Stay by Specialty: Shows which medical specialties have longer hospital stays.

Area Chart – Medications Prescribed vs. Time in Hospital: Indicates a correlation between number of medications and hospital stay duration.

🔍 Insight: Specialties with longer stays may need process optimization. Also, more medications might be linked to complex cases or polypharmacy risks—both of which could contribute to readmissions.

Purpose

The project demonstrates how Excel can be used not just for spreadsheets, but also for data analytics and professional dashboard creation, turning raw data into actionable insights.
